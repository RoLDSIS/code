### * Load the local libraries
source ("paths.r")
source ("dwt-lib.r")
source ("compare-methods.r")
source ("scalogram.r")

### * Load the results of the cross-validation procedure
load (file.path (results.dir, "cross-validation.dat"))

### * Open the PDF file
pdf (file = file.path (figures.dir, "cv-scalograms.pdf"),
     width = 6, height = 4)

### * Specify the panels
layout (matrix (c (1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2),
        widths = c (1, 0.82), heights = c (0.68, 1))

### * Counter for panels
panel <- 1

### * Loop over the methods
for (method in names (methods)) {

    ## ** Cumulate the coefficients values per wavelet
    cf <- 0
    for (subj in cohort) {
        ## *** For RoLDSIS use regression coeeficients for reduced data sets
        ## For the other methods, use the coefficoents obtained from the
        ## cross-validation with 3 folds.

                    y.axis = ifelse (panel > 2, FALSE, TRUE))

    ## ** Increase counter
    panel <- panel + 1
